# How I have fun...

## Latin Dance

Started when I was a kid. Favorite catagories are Jive and Samba. One of the highlights:

## Concerts
I was raised on a steady diet of 2000s and 2010s pop and R&B, so naturally, going to concerts is my cardio.
I was a **5 time (London × 2, Chicago × 2, LA) Beyoncé concert goer**.

## Pixel Art
<!--I'm all about pixel art, but only in the cozy 16x16 or 32x32 formats -because let's just say I'm no artist. piece together broken strokes and color blocks, then zoom out and hope it doesn’t look too bad... Some of my work, as you may have seen, was featured on the website as an attempt to brighten up the dull website. -->

I'm all about pixel art, but only in the cozy 16x16 or 32x32 formats—because, truth be told, I’m not exactly an artist. I piece together broken strokes and color blocks, then zoom out and hope it doesn’t look too bad... Some of my work, as you might have noticed, was featured on the site to add a splash of color to an otherwise dull page.

## Detour to Quant
I initially aimed for a career as a quantitative developer before pivoting to computer science. I tutored prospective Financial Engineering students at Peking University (notes available [here](/assets/pdf/interview.pdf)) and developed a deep-deterministic-policy-gradient-based dynamic hedging strategy (repo available [here](https://github.com/tengjiang/options-hedging-with-DDPG)).
