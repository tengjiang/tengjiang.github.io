      <description>I usually go by Sebastian, a name not of my heritage but somehow I feel connected to (See Why Sebastian?).
My fields of interest encompass database systems, software engineering, high-performance computing, and time series analysis. I used to aim for a career as a quantitative developer but I took a sharp turn into Computer Science (See Detour to Quant), and I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that I&amp;rsquo;ve made the right decision.
I feel extremely privileged to be working with and constantly inspired by brilliant minds.</description>
