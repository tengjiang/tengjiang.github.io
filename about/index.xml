      <description>I am a current Master of Science in Computer Science student on the thesis track at Columbia University.
I am generally interested in computer systems. I aspire to become a well-seasoned system programmer, hacker, and researcher.
I mostly go by Teng, sometimes by Sebastian, a name not of my heritage but somehow I feel connected to (See Why Sebastian?).
