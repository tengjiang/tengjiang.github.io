      <description>##Unfinished
On social occasions, I go by Sebastian. I get a lot of &amp;ldquo;Oh, and it is &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s not my given name. I chose it somehow arbitrarily when I was taking French in high school (You know how it went since I never bring that up). But I gave myself several very good reasons to stick to it until today.
First: It&amp;rsquo;s LOOOOOOONG! Sebastian is a refined choice among today&amp;rsquo;s boy names, standing out with his posh feel and substantial size.</description>

      <description>On social occasions, I go by Sebastian, a name I gave myself somehow arbitrarily when I was taking French in high school. I get a lot of &amp;ldquo;Oh, and it is &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s not my given name. My given name is &amp;ldquo;Teng&amp;rdquo;(腾), which should be pronounced as [tʰəŋ], not [tʰɛn].
One of the reasons I chose Sebastian over Teng is the latter&amp;rsquo;s pronunciation: I genuinely do not want people to get confused.</description>

      <description>I just think it would be nice to archive something I&amp;rsquo;ve done so that it would be lost.
I tutor prospective students enthusiastic about Financial Engineering at Peking University. Notes here. Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradient-based Dynamic Hedging Strategy: Repo under construction. </description>
