      <description>On social occasions, I go by Sebastian, a name I gave myself somehow arbitrarily when I was taking French in high school. I get a lot of &amp;ldquo;Oh, and it is &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s not my given name. My given name is &amp;ldquo;Teng&amp;rdquo;(腾), which should be pronounced as [tʰəŋ], not [tʰɛn].
One of the reasons I chose Sebastian over Teng is the latter&amp;rsquo;s pronunciation: I genuinely do not want people to get confused.</description>
