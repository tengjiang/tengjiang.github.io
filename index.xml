      <description>##Unfinished
On social occasions, I go by Sebastian. I get a lot of &amp;ldquo;Oh, and it is &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s not my given name. I chose it somehow arbitrarily when I was taking French in high school (You know how it went since I never bring that up). But I gave myself several very good reasons to stick to it until today.
First: It&amp;rsquo;s LOOOOOOONG! Sebastian is a refined choice among today&amp;rsquo;s boy names, standing out with his posh feel and substantial size.</description>

      <description>I usually go by Sebastian, a name not of my heritage but somehow I feel connected to (See Why Sebastian?).
My fields of interest encompass database systems, software engineering, high-performance computing, and time series analysis. I used to aim for a career as a quantitative developer but I took a sharp turn into Computer Science (See Detour to Quant), and I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that I&amp;rsquo;ve made the right decision.
I feel extremely privileged to be working with and constantly inspired by brilliant minds.</description>
